When an user want to create a new ballot, ACVO's main contract create a child ballot contract what have the functions about voting. While creating a child contract, it's address to be paired with a random number what is called as ID. Users can use this ID to reach spesific ballot. Everyone can create a new ballot and join the system, the cost of creating a new ballot is 0.0005 ETH + gasfee (For ropsten test).
0.0005 ETH is for main contract of ACVO. This balance is going to use for developing the technology (Vulcan promise!). 

After created a new ballot, creator can share his/her own ballot's ID to share and earn money. Creators earn money from candidates who want to participate in voting. The cost of being a candidate is 0.0003 ETH + gasfee (For ropsten test).
0.0003 ETHis for creator and only creator can withdraw it. This balance is creator's so, we do not care what creator do with this money. As you can see from contract's code; even ACVO's main contract can't reach this balance, it is "creator only" function.

Voting is free and no track. As you can see from contract's code (again); ACVO doesn't record which wallet voted for whom, It only record "do that wallet vote or not". We are aware that this creates new problems; Problems are meant to be solved, and ACVO has already solved many of the problems in the "voting" area, where the blockchain has been tried to be used since its inception, even while it was still in the testing phase.

FAQ
----------

1-) What is the "different methods from usual"?

Everyone can be/show a candidate to any ballot. This looks like a big innovation but not finished yet. We are working in a new "undo" function. Voters can "undo" their vote on the basis of voting and vote any candidate again. This is the actual "active voting" and in this way, the preference of the audience in the process can be seen. This feature is going to add ASAP.

2-) Where did you lose UI/UX or your design talent?

Okay, this may be the most asked question but we are developing ourselves and mainnet launch is going to be with new design and "different methods from usual".

3-) Is there a ACVO Token plan?

No. We are against the unnecessary use of token just to gain liquidity.

4-) How can I invest?
ACVO is a voting platform, not an investment platform. Using ACVO and reporting your feedback will make the greatest contribution to us.

5-) Whe are the founders of ACVO?
Ali Bertay SOLAK (developer) and Deniz San GÃœRLER (mastermind).
